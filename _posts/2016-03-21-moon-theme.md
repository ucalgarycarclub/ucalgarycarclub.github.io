<center><b>IBA</b> Come show off your ride!</center>
     
Meets start at 5pm and are located at the SW corner of the Market Mall parking lot.

Usual rules apply (no revving, stunting, racing, etc.) Please be respectful to the area; this is a time to socialize and meet everyone.

We will also be hosting events at Ghost Lake, while the lake is still frozen. These will occur every other week on Sundays at 1pm (starting Feb. 12). Drifting, racing, etc. will be allowed at Ghost Lake, but you must do so in a safe manner. Unsafe behaviour will not be tolerated. Let's have a good season!
