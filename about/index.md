<center>Hi and welcome to the UCalgary Car Club (UCC)!</center>

## Who are we?
There is a large car community both on campus and citywide, yet only a few dedicated car clubs, many that only meet in the summer. That’s where we come in! UCC will be hosting weekly meets/events all academic year long.

## How do I join UCC?
To apply for membership, simply message us with your name and email and that’s it, 100% free.

Membership gives you exclusive access on events, raffles, prizes, and more throughout the year. If you’d like to be featured on the page, send us a picture of you and your car. 

We look forward to meeting everyone. Thanks!

## Disclaimer*
We are currently pursiung registration with the Student's Union.

## Website is still WIP
Our website is still being developed and our content has not been finalized. To report any bugs/glitches, please send an email to jreyden.bangloy@ucalgary.ca.
